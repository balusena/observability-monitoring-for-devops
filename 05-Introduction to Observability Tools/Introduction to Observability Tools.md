# Introduction to Observability Tools

## Introduction to Observability Tools

Observability tools are essential for understanding the internal state of complex systems by collecting and analyzing 
telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. They provide insights into the behavior and performance of applications
and infrastructure, allowing teams to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues. 

Key observability tools include:
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and monitoring,
- **Grafana** for data visualization,
- **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack)** for log analysis,
- **Jaeger and Zipkin** for distributed tracing.

These tools enable DevOps and SRE teams to achieve real-time visibility, improve performance, and ensure system reliability.
