# Observability and Monitoring for DevOps

![Observability and Monitoring for DevOps](https://github.com/balusena/observability-monitoring-for-devops/blob/main/observability-monitoring.png)

The **AWS DevOps Project** repository is a comprehensive solution aimed at deploying, managing, and monitoring the 
**RoboShop application** within a cloud-native environment. This project features multiple microservices, including 
**frontend, catalogue, user, cart, payment, shipping, and dispatch**, each responsible for critical aspects of the 
application. 

To ensure robust infrastructure management, the repository incorporates various **Terraform modules**, such as 
**tf-module-documentdb, tf-module-elasticache, tf-module-rds, and tf-module-rabbitmq**, enabling the automated setup 
of essential AWS services like **DocumentDB, ElastiCache, RDS**, and **RabbitMQ**. Networking is handled through 
**tf-module-vpc** and **tf-module-alb**, providing secure communication and effective load balancing.

The project also integrates automation tools, including **roboshop-ansible** for OS-level configurations, **roboshop-jenkins**
for continuous integration and delivery, and **roboshop-kubernetes** for orchestrating containerized applications on **AWS EKS**. 

Observability and monitoring are managed through tools like the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**, **Prometheus**,
**Grafana**, and **New Relic** for application performance monitoring (APM), ensuring real-time logging, metrics, and alerts. 

This repository serves as a full-fledged DevOps pipeline, enabling teams to deploy, monitor, and scale the **RoboShop application**
efficiently, with an emphasis on operational resilience and optimized performance in a cloud environment.
