# tf-module-alb

The tf-module-alb repository is dedicated to storing the Terraform files for configuring the Application Load Balancer (ALB)
used in the RoboShop application. These files define the resources and settings necessary to create and manage the ALB, 
ensuring efficient traffic distribution across the various microservices in the RoboShop architecture. By leveraging this 
Terraform module, the team can automate the provisioning of the ALB, enabling features such as health checks, routing rules,
and SSL termination. This approach promotes consistency and scalability, allowing the RoboShop application to efficiently 
handle user traffic while maintaining high availability and performance.
