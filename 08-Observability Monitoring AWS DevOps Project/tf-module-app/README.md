# tf-module-app

The tf-module-app repository is designed for managing the infrastructure of the RoboShop application before transitioning
to EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). This module contains Terraform files that automate the deployment of various components
necessary for the application, such as virtual machines, networking resources, and databases. By using this module,we can 
ensure consistent and repeatable infrastructure setups across development and production environments. Although the focus 
is now shifting to EKS for container orchestration, the tf-module-app remains valuable for managing underlying resources 
and configurations that support the applicationâ€™s performance and reliability.
