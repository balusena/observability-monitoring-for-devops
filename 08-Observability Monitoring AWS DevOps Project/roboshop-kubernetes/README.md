# roboshop-kubernetes

The roboshop-kubernetes repository contains the Kubernetes configuration files and manifests for deploying and managing 
the RoboShop application in a Kubernetes environment. These files define the application's deployment, service, ingress,
and other Kubernetes resources, ensuring that each microservice within RoboShop is properly orchestrated and scaled. By 
using Kubernetes, we can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of the application's containers across a cluster,
ensuring high availability and resilience. The repository plays a crucial role in maintaining the infrastructure as code,
enabling consistent and repeatable deployments, and simplifying the management of the RoboShop application in cloud-native
environments.
