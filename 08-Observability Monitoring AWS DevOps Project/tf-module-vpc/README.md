# tf-module-vpc

The tf-module-vpc repository is designed for storing Terraform files that provision and manage the Virtual Private Cloud 
(VPC) infrastructure for the RoboShop application on AWS. This module automates the setup of the VPC, including subnets,
route tables, internet gateways, and security groups. By creating a secure and isolated network environment, the VPC ensures
that the various microservices of the RoboShop application can communicate efficiently while adhering to security best 
practices. The repository promotes consistent and repeatable deployments, facilitating easy management of the network 
infrastructure as the application scales and evolves in the AWS cloud environment.
