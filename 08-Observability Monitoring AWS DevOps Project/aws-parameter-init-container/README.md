# aws-parameter-init-container

The aws-parameter-init-container is a Kubernetes init container designed to securely retrieve configuration data and 
secrets from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager. Before the main application container starts, 
this init container runs, pulling the necessary parameters and secrets directly into the pod. This approach ensures that 
sensitive information is centrally managed and securely injected into the application at runtime, reducing the risk of 
exposing secrets in the codebase or environment variables. It streamlines configuration management in cloud-native 
environments, allowing applications to dynamically load configurations based on the deployment context or environment.
