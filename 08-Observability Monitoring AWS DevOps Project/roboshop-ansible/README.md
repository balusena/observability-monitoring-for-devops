# roboshop-ansible

The roboshop-ansible repository contains the Ansible playbooks used for configuring the operating system (OS) level settings
of the RoboShop project. These playbooks automate the deployment and management of the RoboShop application's infrastructure,
ensuring consistency across all environments. They handle tasks like installing required packages, setting up network configurations,
managing users, and applying security policies. By using Ansible, we can efficiently manage OS-level configurations, reduce manual 
intervention, and ensure that all nodes in the environment are consistently configured and ready for application deployment and
monitoring.
