# roboshop-jenkins

The roboshop-jenkins repository is dedicated to storing the Jenkins files used in the RoboShop project. These files 
define the Jenkins pipelines, which automate the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for 
the application.The Jenkins files outline the steps for building, scanning, releasing, deploying and monitoring the 
RoboShop components, ensuring that code changes are automatically integrated and deployed across environments. By 
leveraging Jenkins, we can maintain efficient and reliable CI/CD workflows, enabling rapid development cycles, minimizing
manual interventions, and ensuring that new features and fixes are quickly and consistently delivered to production.
