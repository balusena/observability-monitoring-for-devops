# tf-module-rds

The tf-module-rds repository is dedicated to storing Terraform files for provisioning and managing Amazon RDS (Relational
Database Service) with MySQL for the RoboShop application. This module automates the setup of RDS instances, including 
configurations for storage, security groups, parameter groups, and backup settings. By using RDS, the RoboShop application 
benefits from a fully managed database service that simplifies database maintenance, scaling, and high availability. The 
repository ensures consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments, allowing the development team to 
focus on application features while RDS handles routine database management tasks, enhancing overall performance and 
reliability.
