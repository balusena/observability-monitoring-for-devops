# roboshop-terraform

The roboshop-terraform repository holds the Terraform files used to provision and manage the infrastructure for the 
RoboShop application across development and production environments. These Terraform scripts define the cloud resources
required for each environment, such as virtual machines, networking components, databases, and load balancers. By using
Terraform, we can ensure consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment across all environments. The repository 
enables infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing for version-controlled, automated provisioning, and easy scaling or 
modification of resources, ensuring that each environment dev and prod remains consistent and properly configured.
