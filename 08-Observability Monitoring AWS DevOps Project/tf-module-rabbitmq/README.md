The tf-module-rabbitmq repository is designed for storing Terraform files that provision and manage RabbitMQ on EC2 instances
for the RoboShop application. This module automates the deployment of RabbitMQ, a robust messaging broker that facilitates 
communication between microservices. It includes configurations for EC2 instances, security groups, and networking, ensuring 
a reliable and secure messaging environment. By leveraging RabbitMQ, the RoboShop application can efficiently handle message 
queuing, allowing for asynchronous processing and improved scalability. This repository simplifies the setup and management of 
RabbitMQ infrastructure, enabling seamless integration and enhancing the overall performance of the application.
