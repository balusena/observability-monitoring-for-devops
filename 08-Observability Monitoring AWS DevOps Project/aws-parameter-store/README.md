# aws-parameter-store

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a secure, scalable, and fully managed service that allows you to centrally manage
configuration data and secrets. It enables you to store values as plain text or encrypted data, such as database credentials,
API keys, and configuration settings. These parameters can be referenced in your applications, scripts, and AWS services, 
ensuring consistent configurations across environments. Parameter Store also integrates with AWS Identity and Access 
Management (IAM), enabling fine-grained access control. Additionally, it supports versioning and auditing, allowing you 
to track changes and maintain secure, organized configuration management in your AWS environment.
