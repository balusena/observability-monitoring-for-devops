# tf-module-eks

The tf-module-eks repository stores the Terraform files for provisioning and managing an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
cluster for the RoboShop application. This module simplifies the setup of Kubernetes clusters, enabling the deployment and scaling
of microservices with ease. It includes configurations for cluster creation, node groups, networking settings, and IAM roles, 
ensuring a robust and secure environment. By using EKS, the RoboShop application benefits from a managed Kubernetes service that
handles the complexity of cluster management, allowing the development team to focus on application features and performance. 
This repository is essential for maintaining a scalable and resilient architecture.
