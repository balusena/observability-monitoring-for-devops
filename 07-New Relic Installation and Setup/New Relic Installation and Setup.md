# New Relic Installation and Setup

## New Relic Overview

![NewRelic]()

New Relic is a powerful observability platform designed to monitor the performance of applications and infrastructure in
real-time. It provides a suite of tools that enable developers and operations teams to gain insights into their systems 
through metrics, logs, and traces. With features like Application Performance Monitoring (APM), real user monitoring (RUM),
and synthetic monitoring, New Relic helps identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and enhance user experience. Its 
intuitive dashboard and advanced analytics capabilities allow for easy visualization and troubleshooting, making it an 
essential tool for teams aiming to improve reliability and maintain system health in dynamic environments.

## Legacy Monitoring vs. New Relic Monitoring

### 1. **Legacy Monitoring**
   - **Approach**: Typically relies on manual checks, system logs, and basic resource monitoring like CPU, memory, and 
   disk usage.
   - **Data Collection**: Limited to individual components or static infrastructure, often using predefined thresholds.
   - **Alerting**: Generates alerts based on static thresholds, leading to frequent false positives or missed issues.
   - **Scope**: Focuses on infrastructure monitoring rather than application performance or user experience.
   - **Drawbacks**: Lacks real-time insights, proactive monitoring, and deep visibility into application health. It 
   struggles with dynamic, cloud-native environments.

### 2. **New Relic Monitoring**
   - **Approach**: Provides full-stack observability, covering applications, infrastructure, and user experience in 
   real-time.
   - **Data Collection**: Collects metrics, logs, and traces from distributed systems, microservices, and dynamic cloud 
   environments.
   - **Alerting**: Utilizes dynamic baselines and AI-driven alerts, reducing noise and improving detection of actual issues.
   - **Scope**: Monitors performance metrics, transactions, and dependencies across the stack, providing a unified view 
   of application health.
   - **Advantages**: Offers detailed insights into application performance, proactive monitoring, and visualization, 
   making it ideal for modern, complex infrastructures.
